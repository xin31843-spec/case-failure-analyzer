Attribution engine (`scripts/attribution/engine.py`)

Runs the gates in fixed order and returns the first complete attribution. The
order is load-bearing — regression tests pin the boundaries between gates (a bare
`chaotic` keyword must not reach Gate 4, an unbound `D+03` hazard must not reach
Gate 3, a recovered SCF error must not reach Gate 6) — so it is declared here
once, as data, rather than implied by the control flow of a long function.

Gate 6 always matches, so the loop always returns and the trailing `raise` is
unreachable; it exists so that a future edit which makes Gate 6 conditional fails
loudly instead of returning `None` into the caller.
